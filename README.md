# ClickTime Intern Assignment

We've built a simple word game relying on React for the front-end code and Node for the back-end. If you're new to React, TypeScript, or Node, don't worry! There are plenty of working examples to build on.

This word game is a single page application. All updates happen within the page, without ever switching between different links. The player can enter their username, select a category, and play a game. There is a very limited set of phrases used for the application, and a player can either click on keys or use keystrokes to select letters and play.

Your task is to complete either the front-end track or the back-end track of exercises. Please choose only ONE of the two paths. Each path was designed to take no more than 4-6 hours to complete, so please choose whichever one you are more comfortable with. If it is taking significantly longer, you might be overthinking your solution!

Keep in mind that part of the challenge of these exercises is to adapt to existing code structure and functionality. So again, don't worry if you think you're supposed to know it all already - there are examples for you to draw upon.

We've provided some information below to help you get setup. There is also documentation specific to your track in the linked documentation for each one. Good luck!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Check your version of node with `node --version`. Make sure you have version >= 12 installed on your machine. If you don't, you can download node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Our Stack

For this project, we use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). You do not need to know about NextJS for this project - it's mainly been used to simplify our setup.

The client-side code is written in React, with both TypeScript and JavaScript versions available. While React knowledge is helpful, it is _not_ a prerequisite for doing the front-end track.

The server-side code is written in TypeScript. If you're new to TypeScript, our setup should feel very similar to that of any other statically-typed language, object oriented language.

While you are free to change any code as you see fit, you should also be able to find some similarities between the exercises and some existing code, and draw inspiration from existing functionality.
